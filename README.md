ExchangeWebServices CreateAsync extension
==============================

Extension for ExchangeService from the EWS managed API to add asynchronous email sending.
See `ExchangeEmailProvider.cs` for usage. The whole thing's a demo... use at your own risk.

Obviously ExchangeWebServices comes with its own license, so read that if you're bored and lonely.
